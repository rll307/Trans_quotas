# Introduction
I hope this script is useful for researchers in fields of linguistics and applied linguistics. Unfortunately due to regulations form the ethic research committee, I am unable to provide my data (actual comments and their classification). However, the article explains all classification and a link for the post is available (see bellow).

If you have any further questions, please feel free to drop me a line.


# Data scraping

The data in this article were collect from a post by [Quebrando o Tabu's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quebrandootabu/) page. **Quebrando o Tabu** is an independent news media agency in Brazil.

Unfortunately, the tool used for data collection, *Netvizz*, is no longer
working because of Facebook’s new policies. Today an alternative would
be [Facepage](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager).

## Criteria for scraping data

1. The comments were scraped form Quebrando o Tabu's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/quebrandootabu/) page;
1. I scraped comments 24 hours after the post. Please, note that some comments might be deleted due to users' intervention.
